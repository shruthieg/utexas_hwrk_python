Noticable trends

    1.  Urban cities have the lowest ceiling on average fare. In Urban areas, trips are more likely to be shorter but 
	happen at a higher frequency. The opposite happens to Rural cities: fewer rides that rack up, on average, 
	a higher price per ride. Suburban cities are between the two extremes of Rural and Urban. 
	Suburban have a lower ride count than Urban while having a higher average price per ride.

    2.  Urban areas included in this data set are bunched closer than the other two city types. 
	This means that drivers would not greatly benefit from changing which Urban city they find their riders. 
	Driving outside an Urban city and moving to the Suburbs does not implicitly mean a higher wage 
	for the driver however because there is a larger spread in Suburban areas for total rides needed on average.

    3.  Urban drivers are the only type to have an inverse relationship between the percentage of drivers to riders. 
	Rural and Suburban drivers have the advantage of having a smaller pool of drivers to get a larger portion of the 
	company's total rides. 
	This means that these drivers have a higher chance to obtain more individual rides than their counterparts in Urban settings. 
	This relationship does not correlate to pure profit for individual drivers, however, since we do not have the data for average trip length, 
	average cost of gasoline, average miles per gallon each driver has, etc. for new drivers to plan on where they would succeed most. 
	For this reason, I would suggest an increase in exposure to Suburban areas as they have a higher price per ride, 
	only really missing a higher demand for rides unlike Urban areas.
